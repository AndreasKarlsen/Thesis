This report documents the master thesis done by group dpt109f15 at the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University. The thesis was written as part of the Computer Science (IT) study program in the spring of 2015 at the 10th semester.

The first time an acronym is used it will appear in the format: Threads \& Locks (TL). Inline quotations and names will appear in \textit{italics}. The work presented in this report is based on work or results described in books, articles, video lectures and research papers from outside sources. The full list of acronyms along with the bibliography and appendix, can be found at the end of the report.

We would like to give a special thanks to our supervisor Lone Leth Thomsen, from the Department of Computer Science, for excellent guidance and immaculate attention to detail. She supplied invaluable help throughout the project with professionalism and black humour. Her constructive criticism helped us to narrow down the subject and kept us motivated and enthusiastic about the project.

\andreas{We expect knowledge to C\# and STM}
\andreas{In Design and Integration, we do expect knowledge to C\# as we do not describe the entire syntax (not all production rules)}
In the following sections it is assumed that the reader has knowledge of terminology related to implementation of \ac{STM} system, such as eager vs. lazy updating. If this is not the case a description of the terminology can be found in our previous study\cite[p. 53]{dpt907e14trending}.
