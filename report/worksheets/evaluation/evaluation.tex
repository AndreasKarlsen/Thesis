\worksheetstart{Evaluation}{1}{Marts 2, 2015}{Andreas}{../../}
This chapter evaluates \stmnamesp, its associated \ac{STM} library and locking in C\# according to the characteristics defined in \cite[p. 15-21]{dpt907e14trending}. The evaluation will facilitate a conclusion on whether or not language integrated \ac{STM} is a valid alternative to locking as well as discerning whether language integration of \ac{STM} provides any advantages over library based \ac{STM} in terms of usability.

\section{Selected Problems}
As described in \bsref{sec:problem_statement} the evaluation will be conducted by comparing the characteristics of each approach based on a number of concurrent implementations. For this purpose these know concurrent problems have been selected:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The dinning philosophers problem\cite[p. 673]{hoare1978communicating}.
\item The santa clause problem\cite{trono1994new}
\item Concurrency hashmap
\end{enumerate}
