\worksheetstart{Evaluation of Characteristics}{1}{Marts 2, 2015}{Andreas}{../../}
This chapter evaluates \stmname, its associated \ac{STM} library and locking in C\# according to the evaluation method described in \bsref{sec:eval_approach}. The evaluation facilitates a conclusion on our hypothesis \textit{``Language integrated \ac{STM} provides a valid alternative to locking in terms of usability, and provides additional benefits over library based \ac{STM}, when solving concurrent problems in C\#''}\toby{Be sure it is identical to the one in problem statement at the end} defined in \bsref{sec:problem_statement}.
\label{chap:evaluation}
The following sections describes how each of the three concurrency approaches are evaluated according to the characteristics. The evaluation follows the approach defined in \bsref{sec:eval_approach} where each the three concurrency approaches is given a placement of the spectrum of each of the characteristics.

\section{Implicit or Explicit Concurrency}
All the selected concurrency approaches rely on starting threads in order to introduce concurrency as well as manually specifying critical regions using either locks or the \bscode{atomic} block. This makes all the approaches lean toward the explicit end of the spectrum. The two \ac{STM} based approaches are more implicit as \ac{STM} allows abstracts away synchronization details. Locking in C\# on the other hand requires explicit stating how synchronization is to be achieved and is therefore placed close to the explicit concurrency extreme. \stmnamesp and the \ac{STM} library reside slightly more towards the implicit concurrency end of the spectrum. The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the implicit - explicit concurrency spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_implicit_explicit}.

\end{figure}

\section{Fault Restrictive or Expressive}
Locking presents the programmer with a set of constructs aimed at solving concurrency problems but does little to guarantee correct usage. The locking constructs in C\# is explained in detail in \bsref{sec:locking}. Locking enable control of synchronization at a very low level of detail, which is very expressive. Therefore, locking in C\# is placed at the expressive end of the spectrum.

The \ac{STM} based approaches delegate the details of how synchronization is achieved to the underlying \ac{STM} system, allowing \ac{STM} based concurrency to avoid some of the errors associated with locking, such as deadlocks. The \ac{STM} based approaches however still rely on shared memory for communication and require programmers to define transaction scopes and introduce concurrency by starting threads. The high abstraction of \ac{STM} limits the possibility of expressing synchronization at low level details. The \ac{STM} based approaches reside towards the expressive end of the spectrum but contain fault restrictive elements pulling them more towards the fault restrictive extreme than locking. The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the fault restrictive - expressive spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_fault_expressive}.

 \caption{Concurrency approaches on the fault restrictive - expressive spectrum}
\label{fig:char_fault_expressive}
\end{figure}

\section{Pessimistic or Optimistic}
Locking applies synchronization by enforcing mutual exclusion. This approach is well suited in scenarios where errors are common resulting in a high number of aborts if an \ac{STM} based approach had been used. Locking is therefore an inherently pessimistic concurrency approach as it prevents errors from occurring instead of correcting them when they occur. \ac{STM} on the other hand allows multiple threads to proceed simultaneously, correcting any errors that may occur by aborting and re-executing transactions. Hence \ac{STM} takes an optimistic approach to concurrency.
Therefore \stmnamesp and the \ac{STM} library resides at the optimistic extreme of the pessimistic - optimistic spectrum while locking resides at the pessimistic extreme. The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the pessimistic - optimistic spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_pes_opti}.

\end{figure}

\section{Readability \& Writability}\label{subsec:tl_charac_read_and_write}
The evaluation of readability and writability is based on a number of shared criteria: Simplicity, Orthogonality, Data Types, and Syntax Design. The analysis of Data Types and Syntax Design will not be evaluated on a spectrum of two extremes, as the choices made are trade-offs affecting other characteristics, e.g. simplicity and readability. The analysis will therefore be taken into account when the other characteristics are evaluated.

In addition to the shared criteria, writability is based on the level of abstraction and expressivity.
%that of simplicity and orthogonality as well as a number of other considerations. Simplicity and orthogonality is described in the following sections followed by a final evaluation of readability.
\subsection{Data Types}\label{subsec:datatypes}
All three concurrency approaches are either integrated or build around C\#, which means they have almost the same data types. The difference lies in the \ac{STM} approaches, where transactional variables are introduced, and the types of these are treated differently in each approach. In the \ac{STM} library, transactional variables are defined using transactional types, such as \bscode{TMInt}, which means that it is possible to create an array or list containing these types, e.g. \bscode{TMInt[]} defines an array of \bscode{TMInt} types. \stmname instead  preserves the original types of transactional variables, allowing the programmer to utilize an \bscode{atomic} variable of type $T$ as if it was of type $T$ even though the compiler transforms the type of the variable to $T$'s corresponding \ac{STM} type, as described in \bsref{subsec:extension_field}. As transactional variables are not special types in \stmname it is not possible to define a list or array of transactional variables directly, instead a wrapper class with an \bscode{atomic} field must be employed.

The need to define an array of transactional types was experienced during the development of the hashmap implementations which use such an array to represent the buckets of the hashmap. \bsref{lst:lib_Buckets} and \bsref{lst:lang_Buckets} show how the hashmap buckets are defined in the \ac{STM} library and \stmname, respectively. In the library \ac{STM} example on line \ref{line:lib_bucket} the buckets are defined directly. The type of the \bscode{\_buckets} field will be explained gradually. The inner \bscode{Node} type, is a simple class which represents a key value pair, where the value is a transactional variable, defined in the \ac{STM} library code on line \ref{line:lib_node_c} and in \stmname code on line \ref{line:lang_node_c}. The \bscode{Node} is wrapped in an \bscode{ImmutableList} which represents the collision list of a given bucket. The list is immutable, allowing the \ac{STM} system to track changes to the list. This is due to the tracking granularity being only on variables, as described in \bsref{sec:tracking}, and if it was a regular list which changed, the \ac{STM} system would not notice it. The \bscode{ImmutableList} is wrapped in a \bscode{TMVar} for the \ac{STM} system to track changes to the list, each of these then represents a single bucket which is why there is an array of these types. Finally this array is also wrapped in a \bscode{TMVar} allowing the \ac{STM} system to track assignments to the entire backing array in order to resize it when it reaches the load factor threshold. In the \stmname example on line \ref{line:lang_bucket} it is not possible to define the array of transactional variables directly, so a wrapper type called \bscode{Bucket} defined on line \ref{line:lang_bucket_class} is used. This is a consequence of the design of the \ac{STM} system.

      {
        Key = key;

      }
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Ultimately prohibiting the programmer to define an array or list of transactional types directly, lowers the readability and writability of \stmname, as it requires the programmer to write, read and maintain an extra wrapper class. To remedy this, a library of data structures which provides tracking to internal changes could be included in the language. 

The special types used by the \ac{STM} library to represent transactional variables requires the programmer to use the \bscode{Value} property whenever they need to make an assignment. Implicit conversion ensures that an object of one of the \ac{STM} types, such as \bscode{TMInt}, can, in most cases, be used as if it was an object of the type it is wrapping. \bsref{lst:lib_implicit_conversion} shows an equality comparison of two transactional variables using the \ac{STM} library. The comparison on line \ref{line:lib_equality} requires the programmer to access the \bscode{Value} property of the \bscode{TMVar} objects as implicit conversion will not be used if the \bscode{TMVar}'s are compared directly, resulting in reference comparison of the \bscode{TMVar} objects producing an incorrect result. A similar problem exists when calling a method on a \bscode{TMVar} object, implicit conversion does not allow methods of the wrapped type to be called on the \bscode{TMVar} directly.

    TMVar<bool> v2 = new TMVar<bool>(false);
    return v1.Value == v2.Value;~\label{line:lib_equality}~
  }
\end{lstlisting}

The two \ac{STM} based approaches have problems combining with existing data structures. For example, if a programmer utilizes a \bscode{List<T>} inside a transaction, any operations on the list are not tracked by the \ac{STM} system as \bscode{List<T>} is not implemented using transactional variables. Therefore operations on the list take effect immediately. A transaction may be executed multiple times due to being aborted and retried, resulting in the operations, such as adding an element to the list, being executed and taking effect multiple times. Consequently data structures utilized in transactions must be: \begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
  \item Build using transactional variables, allowing the \ac{STM} system to track any changes, or
  \item Immutable and tracked through assignment to a transactional variable.
\end{inparaenum}  

%Extra der påvirker data types:
	%Måske nævn det har samme behaviour som virtual modifieren (var det ikke det du sagde kasper?)
	%Måske noget om at ac# fungerer også med ref og out (som library ikke kan), så det har en bedre integartion med datatyperne i sporget?? (men det er jo keywords det integreres med, så måske en anden formulering)
	%Andreas skrevet: Using STM types could imply a different meaning and confusing the programmer. Is TMInt the same value as int?
\subsection{Syntax Design}\label{subsec:syntaxdesign}
The use of keywords reduce simplicity but increase readability, as the intent stands out clearly\cite[p. 12-13]{sebestaProLang}. Locking in C\# uses only a single keyword, \bscode{lock}. The rest of the functionality is provided by library calls as described in \bsref{sec:locking}. The use of libraries for locking constructs makes it blend in with other library code, even though it has a special purpose. This decreases the readability, but keeps the simplicity of the language as it does not introduce keywords for all constructs. 

The \ac{STM} library also uses library calls as described above, thus it has the same disadvantages and the readability is decreased compared to \stmname which has keywords for the special constructs. The four keywords introduced in \stmname do however decrease the simplicity of the language. As the \bscode{atomic} keyword has different meanings depending on the context in \stmname, its readability is reduced and the simplicity is raised by keeping a minimum of keywords. 

The \ac{STM} library requires the programmer to use static method calls, wrap transactional code in lambdas, wrap transactional variables in a \bscode{TMVar}, use the \bscode{Value} property when getting or setting a value, supply \bscode{orelse} transactions as arguments to the atomic method call, and write return in front of the static method call if a method must return the value computed by a transaction. All of these concerns are abstracted away in \stmname.

In \stmname, an \bscode{atomic} variable can be passed directly as a non-\bscode{atomic} argument, and the language will provide the encapsulated value. In the \ac{STM} library, this is not the case, and the programmer has to manually call the \bscode{Value} property on the \bscode{atomic} variable to get the value. In this case, both the readability and simplicity is increased in \stmname compared to the \ac{STM} library, as the code gets less cluttered, thus easier to read.

In C\# it is possible to name variables by reserved keywords, by prefixing the name with \bscode{@}. Due to this, the impact of the additional keywords in \stmname on the naming of variables is reduced and it is distinguishable when \bscode{atomic} is used as a name or a keyword.

\subsection{Low or High Simplicity}\label{subsec:simplicity}
Locking is based on the idea of mutual exclusion. C\# supplies a number of different constructs for defining synchronization using locking as described in \bsref{sec:locking}. Applying locking correctly in complex scenarios is considered to be hard\cite[p. 56]{sutter2005software}, mainly due to the number of errors that can arise, such as deadlocks. 

Locking requires the programmer to explicitly state how synchronization is to be applied. Both library based \ac{STM} and \stmname take a more declarative approach than locking when specifying what needs to be synchronized, thus it is simpler as the programmer does not have to worry about the lower level details. The usability studies produced by Rossbach et al. in \cite{rossbach2010transactional} and Pankratius et al in \cite{pankratius2009does} find that the surveyed students found \ac{STM} simpler than fine grained locking but more complex than coarse grained locking due to issues understanding the execution of transactions. In case of conditional synchronization, both forms of \ac{STM} can leverage the \bscode{retry} functionality and make a transaction block until the variables previously read by the transaction are changed by another transaction. In C\# a \bscode{Monitor} allows blocking until another thread notifies the blocked thread, but contrary to \bscode{retry} this is not on a declarative level. The \bscode{retry} statement was used in the two \ac{STM} based queue implementations to, with only two lines of code, make the calling thread block until the queue is non empty in case \bscode{Dequeue} is called on an empty queue. The same feature in the lock based implementation would require the use of the \bscode{Monitor} class's \bscode{Wait} and \bscode{Pulse/PulseAll} methods, required the programmer to manage low level details. 

\bsref{lst:lock_add_hashmap} and \bsref{lst:lang_add_hashmap} show the \bscode{Add} method for the locking and library based \ac{STM} hashmap implementations respectively. The locking hashmap implementation needs different locks for different critical regions. In \bsref{lst:lock_add_hashmap} on line \ref{line:lock_lock_bucket}, a calculation is made to check which needs to be used, additionally on line \ref{line:lock_lock_size} another lock is needed for synchronizing access to the \bscode{\_size} variable as the previously acquired lock only covers part of the buckets, meaning that another thread could be incrementing the \bscode{\_size} variable. This is avoided in \bsref{lst:lang_add_hashmap} where the method is wrapped in an \bscode{atomic} block, and the \ac{STM} system detects and resolves potential conflicts.

Library based \ac{STM} uses existing language constructs, such as static method calls, however it does not have support for checking implicit dependency between static calls at compile time, e.g. a \bscode{retry} outside an \bscode{atomic} call will not produce a compile time warning. Additionally, the \ac{STM} types provided must be used to track variables in transactions. These types cause a type mismatch when used together with standard types, thus making the library more complex to use. This issue is partly resolved by providing implicit type conversion on the \ac{STM} types, but the implicit conversion is not possible in all cases. In the cases where it is not, the programmer must access the non-\ac{STM} type by the \bscode{Value} property available on all \ac{STM} types. 

\stmnamesp introduces additional language constructs which reduces the simplicity of the language. It does however increase the simplicity of using the \ac{STM} part, e.g. using \bscode{retry} outside of an \bscode{atomic} block will result in a compile time warning. Additionally, \bscode{atomic} can also be used to modify fields, local variables and parameters, making them traceable in transactions without having to use specific types. This simplifies interaction between code that uses \bscode{atomic} variables and code that does not.

The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the low simplicity - high simplicity spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_simplicity}.

% Concurrency related issues are fewer in STM
\subsection{Low or High Orthogonality}\label{subsec:orthogonality}
As described in \bsref{sec:locking}, locking encompasses a number of basic constructs aiding in different concurrency scenarios. These constructs can be combined to handle complex concurrency issues. Some of these combinations are however erroneous producing hard to debug problems such as deadlocks. Locking does not put any restraints on the language features with which it can be combined and may therefore seem to be highly orthogonal. The threat of deadlocks when combining lock based implementations or employing multiple locks limit the orthogonality keeping locking from reaching the high orthogonality extreme. Locking in C\# provides no solutions to these issues. As a result locking in C\# is placed just above the middle of the spectrum towards the high orthogonality end of the spectrum.

\ac{STM} removes the issue of deadlocks and allows \ac{STM} based code segments to be combined using transactional nesting. \ac{STM} combines poorly with irreversible actions, that is actions which can not be rolled back in case a transaction aborts such as \ac{IO}. Neither the \ac{STM} library nor \stmnamesp offers a solution to this problem reducing their orthogonality. Furthermore both the \ac{STM} library and \stmnamesp have problems combining with existing data structures reducing their orthogonality further.

As described in \bsref{subsec:datatypes} the programmer cannot rely on implicit conversion from an \ac{STM} object to the value it wraps in all cases reducing the orthogonality of the \ac{STM} library. The \ac{STM} library however still benefits from the advantages provided by \ac{STM} and is placed just to the right of locking on the low - high orthogonality spectrum. \stmnamesp treats transactional variables as an object of their original type, removing the type mismatch between the regular types and the corresponding \ac{STM} types. As a result, \stmname allows transactional variable to be compared directly and methods can be invoked directly on the transactional variable, without having to reason about implicit conversion or manually accessing the \bscode{Value} property, as described in \bsref{subsec:datatypes}. Therefore \stmname is placed further towards the high orthogonality end of the spectrum than the other two approaches.

The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the low - high orthogonality spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_orthogonality}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Low or High Readability}\label{subsec:char_readability}
As described in \bsref{subsec:syntaxdesign}, locking in C\#, except the lock statement, is provided by library calls, and library \ac{STM} is only provided by library calls. This negatively affect their readability because these calls blends in with other library code and the programmer may wonder if it is defined in the language or it is user defined. To avoid this confusion \stmname uses special keywords which positively affects its readability, however it also negatively affects simplicity and thereby the readability because the programmer has to know these keyword. Also the \bscode{atomic} keyword got different meaning depending on the context in \stmname, which negatively affects the readability, as the programmer must be aware of these different meanings. Much of the boilerplate code necessary in the \ac{STM} library is abstracted away in \stmname, e.g. use of the Value property, which improves its readability as there is less code to reason about.

In \bsref{subsec:datatypes} the data types characteristic is described. The \ac{STM} library treats transactional variables as special types, where \stmname treats transactional variables as regular types with an associated atomic keyword modifier. As a result it is not possible to define an array or list of transactional types directly in \stmname, which reduces its readability, because the extra boilerplate code that the wrapper class introduces, the reader has to reason about. Additionally the \ac{STM} library allows for implicit conversion when getting a transactional value, thereby avoiding to specify the Value property, which positively affects the readability because there is less code to reason about, however this can produce incorrect results e.g. when trying to check for equality, so ultimately the readability suffers.

In \bsref{subsec:simplicity} the simplicity of locking is placed close to the low simplicity extreme, where the \ac{STM} library is placed a bit higher than the middle of the spectrum and \stmname even higher. In \bsref{subsec:orthogonality} the orthogonality of locking resides just above the middle of the spectrum, where the \ac{STM} library resides a little higher and \stmname again a little higher. These characteristics directly influence the readability of the concurrency approaches.

All the concurrency approaches have to explicitly mark critical regions of code in order to ensure a program is race condition free. This negatively affects their readability, as by reading the program it is hard to know whether critical regions are marked correctly everywhere, and it is especially hard in large programs.

The basic \bscode{lock} construct and idea behind locking is simple, as a resource is locked, preventing others from using it. This positively affects the readability of locking and in small code segments it may seem highly readable. However locking suffers in particular from the concurrency issue of deadlocks. This negatively affects the readability of locking drastically, as in order to reason about deadlocks, the programmer has to reason about every code segment where locking is applied and how these segments interact. As locking code can be fragmented it can become hard for the programmer to reason about. Additionally, if a program makes use of other libraries that uses locking internally, the programmer also have to reason about the locks contained within those libraries, as locks do not compose. The readability of locking is therefore placed towards low readability on the spectrum.

The \ac{STM} approaches remove the issue of deadlocks, which positively affects the readability, as the programmer does not have to reason about deadlocks. Additionally, \ac{STM} also removes the issue of composing synchronized code segments, as \ac{STM} allows for nested transactions. Just as locking, \ac{STM} suffers from code fragmentation which can make it hard to get an overview of all the \ac{STM} synchronization in a program, which affects the readability negatively. Furthermore understanding the concept of memory transactions can, as described in \cite{rossbach2010transactional}, at first be hard to grasp, as it promotes a new way of synchronizing programs, and especially since both the \bscode{orelse} and \bscode{retry} constructs have been included in the \ac{STM} library and \stmname. Furthermore, \stmname is able to produce compile time warnings, e.g. when a \bscode{retry} keyword is defined outside an \bscode{atomic} scope, which improves its readability over the \ac{STM} library, which is not able to do so. Additionally, library \ac{STM} have a type mismatch between \ac{STM} types and regular types, which \stmname does not. Therefore \stmname has an even higher readability than the \ac{STM} library.

Ultimately the \ac{STM} library is placed close to the middle on the spectrum and \stmname further towards the high readability extreme. The main drawback factor for both is that the programmer have to mark critical regions of code which can be very fragmented and that understanding the concept of memory transactions may at first be hard, especially as both the \bscode{orelse} and \bscode{retry} constructs have been introduced.

The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the low readability - high readability spectrum is shown in \bsref{fig:char_readability}.

\subsection{Low or High Level of Abstraction}\label{subsec:level_of_abstraction}
Locking is tightly coupled with the hardware architecture through hardware instructions such as Test-and-set and Compare-and-swap\cite[p. 1990]{scott2011sync}. Furthermore low-level abstraction threads are used in order to introduce concurrency. Additionally the programmer has to state exactly how synchronization should be applied using locks. C\# offers the \bscode{lock} statement which provides a small abstraction over the release of a lock. The \bscode{lock} statement is however not applicable in all cases. If for example a timeout on the acquisition of a lock is required or a more advanced form of lock, such as a semaphore, is required, the \bscode{lock} keyword is not directly applicable. That is the case in the locking Dining Philosophers implementation, which requires the second lock to be taken with a timeout. Additionally the correct usage of the \bscode{Monitor} lead to the use of a \bscode{try/finally} block to ensure that the acquired lock is released in case of an exception reducing the level of abstraction. Furthermore the flow of the locking Santa Claus implementation uses semaphores to signal between Santa, the elfs and the reindeer. The \bscode{lock} keyword does not provide such capabilities. Ultimately locking in C\# is placed close to the low level of abstraction extreme of the spectrum with the small abstractions provided keeping it from being at the extreme. 

The \ac{STM} approaches also rely on threads, but provide a higher level of abstraction for synchronization. \ac{STM} uses transactions, where code segments are marked and the details of how synchronization is achieved is abstracted away to the \ac{STM} system. For both \stmname and the \ac{STM} library facilities strong atomicity, as described in \bsref{sec:design_strong_weak_atomicity} and the \ac{STM} system will therefore manage both transactional and non-transactional access, thus keeping the level of abstraction high. Based on the above, the general \ac{STM} approach lies between the middle and high end of the spectrum, where the main negative factors is that the programmer still has to manage threads and mark regions of code that should be synchronized.

As to \stmname and the \ac{STM} library individually, some differences in the level of abstraction exist. As described in \bsref{subsec:syntaxdesign} the \ac{STM} library requires the programmer to use static method calls and lambdas for defining transactions. \stmname substitutes this with language based support for the \bscode{atomic} block. \bsref{lst:lib_SleepUntilAwoken} and \bsref{lst:lang_SleepUntilAwoken} present an implementation of the \bscode{SleepUntilAwoken} method from the library and \stmname Santa Claus problem implementations, respectively. The method ensures that Santa sleeps until he is awoken by either three elfs at his door, or all reindeers back from vacation ready to fly his sleigh. The \bscode{return} statement on line \ref{line:lib_sleep_return} of \bsref{lst:lib_SleepUntilAwoken} is not present in the l\stmname implementation as it is abstracted away by \stmnamesp. Furthermore the static method call and creation of lambas to represent transaction bodies on line \ref{line:lib_sleep_return} is abstracted away by the \bscode{atomic} block and orelse block on lines \ref{line:lang_sleep_atomic} and \ref{line:lang_sleep_orelse} of \bsref{lst:lang_SleepUntilAwoken}.

The \ac{STM} library exposes transactional variables as special \ac{STM} types, \stmnamesp instead allows variables to be marked as \bscode{atomic}, letting the programmer keep the original type. Language \ac{STM} is therefore considered to have a higher level of abstraction than library \ac{STM}. As described previously \ac{STM} however combines poorly with irreversible actions leaving it up to the programmer to correctly handle actions such as \ac{IO} in combination with transactions. As neither the \ac{STM} library nor \stmnamesp can abstract over these problem, their level of abstraction is reduced.

The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the low level of abstraction - high level of abstraction spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_level_of_abstraction}.

\subsection{Low or High Expressivity}\label{subsec:expressivity}
%The expressivity of the approaches are closely related to their level of abstraction. 
The locking constructs in C\# give different ways to express exactly how synchronization should be applied by the use of locks and it therefore affects the expressivity positively. Since locking is prone to a number of concurrency related issues, the expressivity is severely reduced as the programmers focus is limited by the more complex synchronization form. Locking in C\# gives the programmer control over many low level details concerning how synchronization is applied but at the same time requires the programmer to specify these details. This along with the threat of deadlocks and other issues limits how the programmer can concisely and conveniently express the functionality. Locking in C\# is therefore placed towards low expressivity, being drawn a bit towards the middle of the spectrum because of the many choices in locking constructs C\# offers.

\ac{STM} also builds upon threads which limits its expressivity. Memory transactions however represent a more declarative and expressive approach than locking, as the programmer only has to specify critical regions allowing the \ac{STM} system to manage the details of how synchronization is applied. This affects the expressivity positively, as it accomplishes a great deal of computation with little code. Furthermore \ac{STM} eliminates the issues of deadlocks which makes it more convenient to express synchronization, as the programmer does not have to reason about it. However, neither in the \ac{STM} library or \stmname there exists a convenient way to express irreversible actions, such as exceptions and \ac{IO}, the programmer is left alone in ensuring these actions work correctly with transactions, which negativity affects the expressivity. Based on the above, the general \ac{STM} approach is placed between the middle and high end of the spectrum.

As to \stmname and library \ac{STM}, there are some differences in expressivity. The expressivity of the approaches is closely related to their level of abstraction, described in \bsref{subsec:level_of_abstraction}. As described in \bsref{subsec:syntaxdesign}, library \ac{STM} requires the programmer to put extra effort into expressing the intended functionality e.g. wrapping transactional code in lambdas, wrapping transactional variables in \bscode{TMVar} types and using the \bscode{Value} property when getting or setting a value on a transactional variable. That is abstracted away in \stmname which makes it more expressive as it provides a more convenient and less tedious way of specifying computations. However, the abstraction that \stmname provides, also disallows the programmer to define an array of transactional types directly and instead requires the programmer to use a wrapper class, as described in \bsref{subsec:datatypes}. Based on the above, \stmname is considered to have a higher expressivity than library \ac{STM} because of the higher level of abstraction that it facilitates, however not much, as defining an array or list of transactional types directly is disallowed.

The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the low expressivity - high expressivity spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_expressivity}.

\subsection{Low or High Writability}
As discussed in \bsref{subsec:level_of_abstraction} locking in C\# has a low level of abstraction due to its usage of low level constructs. While the \bscode{lock} statement provides an abstraction over the acquisition and release of a lock, providing increased writability in cases where it is applicable, the writability of locking in C\# is reduced as a result of the low level of abstraction. The \ac{STM} library's level of abstraction is said to be be just above the middle towards the high level of abstraction end of the spectrum, while \stmname is said to have a higher level of abstraction than the \ac{STM} library. This positively impacts the writability of the \ac{STM} library and \stmname.

The locking constructs described in \bsref{sec:locking} are prone to common locking problems, such as deadlocks, resulting in a low simplicity score which negatively impacts its writability. The expressivity of the \ac{STM} library resides above the middle of the spectrum. The expressivity of the \ac{STM} library is limited due to the requirements of wrapping transactional code in lambdas, wrapping transactional variables in \bscode{TMVar} types and using the \bscode{Value} property when getting or setting a value on a transactional variable, hindering the programmer in concisely expressing the intended behavior and resulting in reduced writability. \stmname removes this burden from the programmer, by delegating the work to the compiler, resulting in a higher expressivity score and improved writability.

With respect to simplicity, locking in C\# is, as described in \bsref{subsec:simplicity}, placed close to the low simplicity end of the spectrum mainly due the number of errors that can arise. This negatively impacts the approach's readability. The two \ac{STM} based approaches benefit from \ac{STM} declarative approach to defining synchronization. The \ac{STM} library is placed just above the middle of the spectrum while \stmname resides further towards the high simplicity end of the spectrum. \stmname is given a higher simplicity score due to its cleaner syntax and the ability to use existing types instead of the \ac{STM} equivalents resulting in a greater positive impact on writability.

As described in \bsref{subsec:orthogonality} locking in C\# has properties which seem orthogonal but it is limited due to the threat of errors when combining locking constructs. The \ac{STM} based approaches benefit from simplified composition based on transactional nesting but simultaneously introduces issues with irreversible actions such as \ac{IO}. The \ac{STM} library has problems combining with existing types in all cases. Furthermore the implicit conversion feature can not be relied on in all cases, requiring the programmer to access the \bscode{Value} property, reducing the libraries orthogonality. Ultimately this results in the \ac{STM} library being placed just between the middle and the high end of the low - high orthogonality spectrum. \stmname address the issues of the \bscode{STM} library by allowing the programmer to use any existing types instead of the \ac{STM} types and by delegating much of the work required by the \ac{STM} library to the compiler. This results in \stmname being placed just above the \ac{STM} library on the  low - high orthogonality spectrum. These scores positively impact the writability of the approaches.

Locking suffers from the fact that a number of serious errors are present resulting in it being hard in complex scenarios limiting its writability. The \ac{STM} based approaches solve many of the errors present with locking but introduces new problems with irreversible actions. The \ac{STM} library has problems with types, accessing the wrapped value and the syntax of transaction definitions with limits its writability. \stmname addresses many of the writability problems present in the \ac{STM} library by delegating the work to the compiler. Based on these observations and the evaluations of the previous characteristics the three approaches have been placed on the low - high writability spectrum as depicted in \bsref{fig:char_tl_writability}.
