This chapter evaluates \stmname, its associated \ac{STM} library and locking in C\# according to the characteristics defined in \cite[p. 15-21]{dpt907e14trending}. The evaluation will facilitate a conclusion on whether or not language integrated \ac{STM} is a valid alternative to locking as well as discerning whether language integration of \ac{STM} provides any advantages over library based \ac{STM} in terms of usability.
\label{chap:evaluation}
\section{Selected Problems}
As described in \bsref{sec:problem_statement} the evaluation will be conducted by comparing the characteristics of each approach based on a number of concurrent implementations. For this purpose three concurrency problems have been selected:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The dining philosophers problem\cite[p. 673]{hoare1978communicating}
\item The santa clause problem\cite{trono1994new}
\item A concurrent hashmap implementation\cite[p. 253]{cormen2009introduction}
\end{enumerate}
The dining philosophers problem represents a well known concurrency problem which highlights some of the pitfalls associated with locking. The Santa Claus problem encompasses a high degree of modeling and requires complex synchronization. As such, employing this problem helps investigate whether \ac{STM} provides any advantages over locking in such scenarios. Finally a concurrent hashmap implementation represents a real world problem, which benefits from fine grained synchronization and is used in many concurrent implementations. Together these problems provide a varied perspective by exerting different aspects of each approach such as: waiting on one of multiple conditions and fine grained synchronization.

\section{Evaluation Approach}
For each of the selected problems an implementation will be created using, locking, library based \ac{STM} and language based \ac{STM}. Based on these implementations each concurrency approach will be evaluated according to the characteristic defined in our previous work 
\cite[p. 15-21]{dpt907e14trending}. While each of these characteristics range from one extreme to another, e.g. high or low readability, a concurrency approach may not reside at one of these extremes, but more likely somewhere in between. Therefore, as part of the evaluation, each concurrency approach will be given a placement on the spectrum of each characteristic, according to the finding of the evaluation. In order to visualize this placement a scale similar to one presented in \bsref{fig:evel_example} is employed. Here \bscode{X} and \bscode{Y} represent the two extremes of the spectrum while the indicators represent the placement of each of the concurrency approaches on the spectrum. As an example \bscode{X} and \bscode{Y} could be low and high writability, \bsref{fig:evel_example} then shows that each of the concurrency approaches resides more towards the high writability end of the spectrum.

\end{figure}
Giving each concurrency approach a visual placement allows for improved communication of the findings along with the ability to easily compare the placement of each concurrency approach.

\section{Implementations}
To ensure common ground between all implementations of a particular problem, a set of requirements detailing common factors which must be true for all implementations of a particular problem has been created.

The dining philosophers implementations must:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Encompass two 100 milliseconds thread sleeps. One to exemplify the act of eating as well as one upon completing an attempt to eat exemplifying a waiting period before attempting to eat again.
\end{itemize}

The santa clause problem implementations must:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Follow the requirements defined in \cite{trono1994new}
	\item Utilize advantageous features of the approach.
\end{itemize}

The concurrent hashmap implementations must:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Encompass fined grained synchronization, allowing multiple threads to operate on the hashmap simultaneously.
\end{itemize}
The implementations in their full length can be found in the appendix.\toby{indsæt et reference når de indsætts}

\section{Evaluation of Characteristics}

\subsection{Implicit or Explicit Concurrency}
All of the selected concurrency approaches relies on starting threads in order to introduce concurrency as well as manually specifying critical regions using ether locks or the \bscode{atomic} block. The two \ac{STM} based approaches however have implicit elements as \ac{STM} allows them to hide the details of how synchronization is achieved. Locking in C\# on the other hand requires explicit stating how synchronization is to be achieved. As such we say that locking in C\# i resides a the explicit concurrency extreme while \stmnamesp and the \ac{STM} library resides slightly more towards the implicit concurrency end of the spectrum. The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the implicit - explicit concurrency spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_implicit_explicit}.

\label{fig:char_implicit_explicit}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fault Restrictive or Expressive}
Locking presents the programmer with a set of tools aimed at solving concurrency problems but does little to guarantee their correct usage. Locking in C\# provides the \bscode{lock} statement\cite[p. 102]{csharp2013specificaiton}, which defines a scope within which a given lock is help. The \bscode{lock} statements handles lock acquisition and release removing the threat of programmers unintentionally missing to release a acquired lock. The lock statement is however only applicable in some scenarios and does, for example, not support timeouts on lock acquisition. As such we say that locking in C\# resides at the expressive end of the spectrum.

The \ac{STM} based approaches delegate the details of how synchronization is achieved to the underling \ac{STM}, allowing \ac{STM} based concurrency to avoid some of the errors associated with locking, such as deadlocks. The \ac{STM} based approaches however rely on shared memory for communication and require programmers to define transaction scopes and introduce concurrency by starting threads. As such the \ac{STM} based approaches reside towards the expressive end of the spectrum but contain elements of fault restrictions pulling it more towards the fault restrictive extreme than was the case for locking. The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the fault restrictive - expressivey spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_fault_expressive}. 
\begin{figure}[htbp]

 \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{\rootpath/worksheets/evaluation/figures/char_fault_expressive} 
 \caption{Concurrency approaches on the fault restrictive - expressive spectrum}
\label{fig:char_fault_expressive}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Pessimistic or Optimistic}
Locking assumes that error are common and therefor allows only a single thread to access a given critical region at a time, by enforcing mutual exclusion. As such locking is a inherently pessimistic concurrency approach. \ac{STM} on the other hand allows multiple threads to proceed simultaneously, correcting any errors that may occur by aborting and re executing transactions. As such \ac{STM} takes a optimistic approach to concurrency.
Therefore we say that \stmnamesp and the \ac{STM} library resides at the optimistic extreme of the pessimistic - optimistic spectrum while locking resides at the pessimistic extreme. The placement of the three concurrency approaches on the fault restrictive - expressivey spectrum is depicted in \bsref{fig:char_pes_opti}.

\subsection{Readability \& Writability}\label{subsec:tl_charac_read_and_write}
As mentioned in \bsref{sec:readability} and \bsref{sec:writablity}, the evaluation of readability and writablity will be based upon the evaluation of the sub characteristics, on which they are based. As two of these, simplicity and orthogonality, are common for both readability and writability, an evaluation of these is presented first. After this, an evaluation of the readability properties of the \ac{TL} concurrency model is presented, followed by the evaluation of \ac{TL} concurrency models level of abstraction and expressivity. Finally an evaluation of the writability of the \ac{TL} concurrency model is presented.

%that of simplicity and orthogonality as well as a number of other considerations. Simplicity and orthogonality is described in the following sections followed by a final evaluation of readability.
\subsubsection{Low or High Simplicity}\label{subsec:simplicity}

\subsubsection{Low or High Readability}
\label{subsec:char_readability}

\label{fig:char_readability}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Low or High Level of Abstraction}\label{subsec:level_of_abstraction}
Locking is tightly coupled with the process thread model of the underlying \ac{OS}, utilizing shared memory for communication and primitives such as \ac{CAS} to implement the locks them selves\cite[p. 1990]{scott2011sync}. Locking leaves it up to the programmer to define how mutual exclusion should be provided, leaving the programmer vulnerable to issues such as deadlocks and priority inversion. C\# offers a number of abstractions for mitigating such issue. These include the \bscode{lock} keyword described earlier and the static methods of the \bscode{Waithandle} class. The \bscode{lock} keyword frees the programmer for having to reason about whether the acquired lock is released in all scenarios, but is not applicable in all cases. If for example a timeout on the acquisition of a lock is require or a more advanced form of lock, such as a semaphore is required, the \bscode{lock} keyword is not directly applicable. This can also been seen in the implementations for the evaluation. Both the locking dinning philosophers implementation and the lock based concurrency hashmap implementation requires the use of the monitor class instead of the lock keyword for acquiring a lock with a timeout. The dinning philosophers implementation requires the second lock to be taken with a timeout and the concurrency hashmap implementation uses a timeout with acquiring the lock on resizing the backing array. Furthermore the flow of the locking santa clause problem implementation uses semaphores to signal between santa, the elfs and the reindeer. The \bscode{lock} keyword does not provide such capabilities.
