\worksheetstart{Requirements for \stmname}{0}{Februar 10, 2015}{}{../../}
This chapter describes the requirements for the \ac{STM} system powering \stmname. The requirements are based on known \ac{STM} constructs and the characteristics, described in \bsref{sec:eval_approach}, which the final system must be evaluated upon. The requirements will be used to design and integrate the \ac{STM} features into C\#, described in \bsref{chap:stm_design}. Furthermore, the requirements will be used to implement the \ac{STM} system, described in \bsref{chap:implementation}.

Tracking granularity is described in \bsref{sec:tracking} followed by a description of the relationship between transactions and variables i.e. what and how variables should be tracked, is addressed in \bsref{subsec:rec_transactions_variables}. \bsref{sec:design_strong_weak_atomicity} describes the choice between strong and weak atomicity. The different types of side-effects and how they are handled is discussed in \bsref{sec:side-effects}. Conditional synchronization is described in \bsref{sec:req_conditional} and nesting in \bsref{sec:stm_req_nesting}. Finally \bsref{sec:stm_req_opacity} describes opacity before a summary of the requirement is given in \bsref{sec:sum_of_req}.

\section{Tracking Granularity}\label{sec:tracking}
A variable tracked by the \ac{STM} system can be tracked with different granularity: by tracking assignments to the variable, or tracking changes to the object referenced by the variable. These different approaches affect the semantics of the \ac{STM} system and will be discussed in the subsequent sections.

\subsection{Tracking of Variables}
Tracking changes to the variable directly limits the effect of the \ac{STM} system to only variables, and not internal changes inside of the referenced object. This is the approach used in the \ac{STM} system in Clojure\cite{clojureConcurrent}. It offers a simple mental model for the programmer, as only changes visible in the transaction scope will be provided with the transactional guarantees of atomicity and isolation.  \bsref{lst:tracking_variable} shows an example, where the field \bscode{\_car} is assigned to a new modified car object on line 11. This assignment is tracked by the \ac{STM} system, as opposed to the example in \bsref{lst:tracking_object}, where the internals of the object are not tracked, when a method with a side-effect is called on line 12. The discussion of side-effects is expanded upon in \bsref{sec:side-effects}.

This approach can be used in combination with both user defined code and code in contained in binaries, but changes to their internals will not be tracked, and therefore the reusability is limited. Should the programmer want transactional support for the side-effects, the internals must be written to use the \ac{STM} system.

    }
  }
  ...
  atomic {
    _car = _car.drive(25);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Tracking of Objects}
Tracking of objects allows the \ac{STM} system to track the internal changes to the fields of an object. This allows the \ac{STM} system to reverse the modification of an object e.g. when an item is added to a collection inside a transaction and the transaction is aborted, the collection can be restored to the state present before the item was added.

Tracking changes to the internals of an object can be done at the level of only a single object or up to the entire object structure, e.g. the objects referenced by the object etc. In \cite{herlihy2003software} Herlihy et al. present a library based \ac{STM} called \ac{DSTM}. \ac{DSTM} uses an approach where the programmer explicitly has to implement an interface, which allows the \ac{STM} system to create a shallow copy of an object. The \ac{STM} system returns a copy of a variable's value to which the transaction can apply its changes. However as the copy is shallow, the internals can reference objects shared with the original. Side-effects on such an object will also affect the original, causing a potentially unintentional breach of isolation. If the programmer want a deeper tracking, she must design the internals using the \ac{STM} system. The example in \bsref{lst:tracking_object} demonstrates a side-effect on the object contained in the \bscode{\_car} variable.  Because the \bscode{\_kmDriven} field is assigned a new value, the changes are detected by the \ac{STM} system. The change to \bscode{\_engine} is however not detected as the \bscode{Car} object is not changed when the \bscode{Engine} is degraded.

In \cite{harris2003language}, Harris et al. present an \ac{STM} system which tracks changes throughout the entire object structure. Changes to objects are buffered in a log and written to the original if the transaction commits. This deep traceability is enabled by having a part of the \ac{STM} system in the runtime system, as the entire structure is known at that level, even if an object is from a compiled library. This approach ensures isolation, but requires modifications to the runtime system. In the example of \bsref{lst:tracking_object}, both \bscode{\_kmDriven} and \bscode{\_engine} will be tracked by \ac{STM} system presented in \cite{harris2003language}.

      _engine.Degrade(km);
    }
  }
  ...
  atomic {
    _car.Drive(25);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Choice of Tracking Granularity}
Deep tracking of objects requires changes to the runtime system which is out of scope for this thesis as described in \bsref{sec:scope}. This leaves the option of either tracking changes to individual objects, but not the objects internals, or only tracking assignments to variables. Providing support for changes to only individual objects may seem inconsistent from the programmerâ€™s point of view, due to changes to referenced objects not being tracked. Therefore tracking of assignments to variables is selected, since it provides a consistent, simple mental model for the programmer, displaying exactly what is tracked by the \ac{STM} system. The consequence of this choice is that the side-effects cannot be tracked automatically, thus potentially burdening the programmer.

\section{Transactions \& Variables}
\label{subsec:rec_transactions_variables}
%Trans keyword
%Atomic block
%Read outside transactions
%No write outside transactions
As described in \bsref{sec:stm_keyconcepts_example} an \ac{STM} system must offer some way of defining a transaction scope. As \stmnamesp is a language integrated \ac{STM} system, C\# must be extended with syntax for specifying a transaction scope.

An \ac{STM} system abstracts away many details of how synchronization is achieved. Simply applying transactions over a number of C\# variables provides a high level of abstraction but also hides the impact of synchronization. Explicitly marking what variables are to be synchronized can assist the programmer in gauging the performance of a transaction as well as improving the understanding of the execution of transactions, both areas which usability studies\cite{rossbach2010transactional}\cite{pankratius2009does} have found to be problematic for some programmers. C\# must be extended with syntax for marking variables for synchronization inside transactions. A variable marked for use in transactions is referred to as a transactional variable. A transactional variable must function similarly to a \bscode{volatile} variable. That is, the language must treat a transactional variable as any other variable of the same type when it is utilized. Thus a transactional variable can be passed as an argument into a method with a parameter that is not tracked. Just like a \bscode{volatile} variable, a transactional variable must be treated differently than normal variables by the compiler. In terms of usability, these differences must however largely be unnoticeable to the programmer.

Applicability is an important aspect when evaluating the usability of \stmname, in comparison to equivalent lock-based and library-based implementations. \stmnamesp must not be overly restrictive as this will limit its applicability. Due to this, the \ac{STM} system must allow reads from transactional variables to occur both inside and outside transactions. For writes to transactional variables a choice exists between allowing and disallowing writes from outside transactions. Disallowing writes from outside transactions will ensure that non-transactional access cannot interfere with transactional access, but it will hamper the usability of the \ac{STM} system. Allowing writes from outside transactions increases the complexity of the implementation, as any conflicts such writes create must be detected and resolved by the \ac{STM} system. Since allowing writes from outside transactions provides the best usability, \stmnamesp must provide support for such writes in addition to writes from inside transactions. This requirement is closely related to the choice between strong and weak atomicity discussed in \bsref{sec:design_strong_weak_atomicity}.

\section{Strong or Weak Atomicity}
\label{sec:design_strong_weak_atomicity}
The atomicity guarantee provided by \ac{STM} systems varies, depending on the semantics provided. In \cite{blundell2006subtleties} Blundell et al. define two levels of atomicity:
%
\begin{defn}\label{def:strong_atomicity}
\emph{[...] strong atomicity to be a semantics in which transactions execute atomically
with respect to both other transactions and non-transactional code.}
\end{defn}
%
\begin{defn}\label{def:weak_atomicity}
\emph{[...] weak atomicity to be a semantics in which transactions are atomic only with respect to other transactions.}
\end{defn}

Strong atomicity provides non-interference and isolation between transactional and non-transactional code, whereas weak atomicity does not. An example of the differences between strong and weak atomicity is presented in \bsref{lst:atomicity}. Using the \bscode{Car} class defined in \bsref{lst:atomicity}, having the \bscode{KmDriven} setter called from one thread, while another thread is calling the \bscode{Drive} method, strong and weak atomicity yields different results. Under strong atomicity, all changes made inside the \bscode{atomic} block on line 12 are isolated from non-transactional code. Additionally, changes made from the setter are isolated from inside the atomic block. The result is that if the setter is called in the middle of the \bscode{Drive} method, a conflict will occur which.

If only weak atomicity is guaranteed, given the same scenario, the change made through the setter would be visible inside the atomic block. Thus accessing the same variables from transaction and non-transactional code can lead to race conditions.

    public void Drive (int km) {
      atomic {
        _kmDriven += km;
      }
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Issues with Atomicity Levels}
In \cite[p. 30-35]{harris2010transactional} Harris et al. summarizes a collection of issues related to the different levels of atomicity. The collection is non-exhaustive, but based on a wide selection of research. The consequence of race conditions can be either:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-repeatable read - if a transaction cannot repeat reading the value of a variable due to changes from non-transactional code in between the readings.
	\item Intermediate lost update - if a write occurs in the middle of a read-modify-write series done by a transaction, the non-transactional write will be lost, as it comes after the transaction has read the value.
	\item Intermediate dirty read - if eager updating\cite[p. 53]{dpt907e14trending} is used, a non-transactional read can see an intermediate value written by a transaction. This transaction might be aborted, leaving the non-transactional code with a dirty read.
\end{itemize}
The second case is exactly the case described in \bsref{lst:atomicity}, where weak atomicity led to the risk of race conditions between transactional and non-transactional code.

Another issue with weak atomicity is known as the privatization problem. If only one thread can access a variable, the need for tracking it through the \ac{STM} system ceases, and so does the associated overhead. It is therefore desirable, to privatize a previously shared variable when doing intensive work that does not need to be shared across threads. A technique used for privatizing a variable, \bscode{x}, is to use another variable as a shared marker \bscode{priv}, which indicates whether or not the \bscode{x} is private. This is demonstrated in \bsref{lst:privatization}. Intuitively one would believe, that if \bscode{Thread1} wants to privatize \bscode{x}, it can set \bscode{priv} to true in a transaction after which \bscode{Thread1} has private access to \bscode{x}. This is however false, since \bscode{Thread2} could read \bscode{priv} and assign to \bscode{x}, after which \bscode{Thread1} executes, setting the values of \bscode{priv} and \bscode{x}, causing the transaction executed by \bscode{Thread2} to abort and rollback. During the rollback the value of \bscode{x} is restored to the value it had when \bscode{Thread2} wrote to it, causing \bscode{Thread1}'s write to \bscode{x}, on line 5, outside of the transaction to be overwritten, and lost. This example assumes weak atomicity, commit-time conflict detection, and in place updating\cite[p. 34]{harris2010transactional}.

  x = 100;
  // Thread 2
  atomic {
    if (!priv) {
      x = 200;
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Choice of Atomicity Level}
All the issues listed above are related to weak atomicity, and are not present under strong atomicity. Despite of the advantage of strong atomicity, its shortcomings must be considered before choosing. The overhead of guaranteeing atomicity between transactional and non-transactional code can occur a considerable cost\cite{spear2007privatization}. In \cite{spear2007privatization} Spear et al. propose four contracts, for which privatization may be guaranteed. Strong atomicity is ranked as the least restrictive, but comes with a considerable cost. Although the performance is not optimal, Hindman and Grossman show in \cite{hindman2006atomicity} that strong atomicity with good performance is achievable by source-to-source compiling with optimizations through static analysis.

As described in \bsref{sec:problem_statement}, the goal of this project is to validate whether \ac{STM} is a valid alternative to locks and provides additional benefits compared to library-based \ac{STM} in terms of usability. Therefore strong atomicity in combination with marked transactional variables is chosen for \stmname as it provides the best usability.

\section{Side-effects}\label{sec:side-effects}
Side-effects in methods are a common idiom in C\#, and come in different shapes and form. Here side-effects are categorized as in-memory side effects, exceptions or irreversible actions. This section discusses the requirements for handling the different types of side-effects in \stmname.

\subsection{In-memory Side-effects}
Side-effects in memory is done by modifying state through references to variables outside of the method scope. An example is \bsref{lst:tracking_object} where the \bscode{Drive} method updates the field \bscode{\_kmDriven} and invokes a method on  \bscode{\_engine}, potentially causing another side-effect. As discussed in \bsref{sec:tracking}, \stmname only track assignments to variables, and not changes to the internals of objects. As a consequence, a side-effect such as the one in \bsref{lst:tracking_object} will persist through an aborted transaction. To remedy this, classes must be implemented to track their internals or be immutable. \bsref{lst:tracking_variable} shows an immutable implementation of the  \bscode{Car} class. This design avoids side-effects, and changes to the object will return a new object, which will be tracked if assigned to a transactional variable.

The immutable approach suits \ac{STM} well, as it is free of side-effects. Additionally it is a less error prone and secure design approach, than mutable objects\cite[p. 73]{bloch2008effective}. Microsoft has an official immutable collection package\footnote{\url{https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bcl.Immutable}}, and is therefore giving first class support for immutability. Furthermore Microsoft recommends the use of immutability for ``[...] small classes or structs that just encapsulate a set of values (data) and have little or no behaviors''\footnote{\url{https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384054.aspx}}. Guidelines for designing immutable objects can be found in Bloch's Effective Java\cite[p. 73-80]{bloch2008effective}.

\subsection{Exceptions}
Different approaches exists for handling exceptions raised inside a transaction. \stmnamesp applies the programmers intuition of how exceptions work in non-transactional code, to transactional code. Therefore, transactions will not be used as a recovery mechanism as proposed by Tim Harris et al. in \cite{harris2005exceptions}.  Instead the exception will be propagated if, and only if, the transaction is able to commit at the point where the exception is raised. Otherwise the transactions will be aborted and re-executed. This way, the programmer will only receive exceptions from code that actually takes effect, and will be able to recover by catching any exceptions, similar to non-transactional code.

\subsection{Irreversible Actions}\label{subsec:irreversible}
Effects such as \ac{IO} performed on disk or network, native calls, or GUI operations are not reversible. This makes them unsuitable for use in transactions, since their effect cannot be undone, should the transaction be aborted. In \cite{duffy2010stmnet}, Duffy proposes using a well known strategy from transaction theory\cite{reuter1993transaction}, having the programmer supply on-commit and on-rollback actions to perform or compensate for the irreversible action. In \cite{harris2005exceptions}, Harris et al. propose that \ac{IO} libraries should implement an interface, allowing any \ac{IO} effects to be buffered until the transactions commit at which point the \ac{IO} library is given a callback. These solutions either burden the programmer using \ac{STM}, or the library designer that must implement a special interface.

While the proposed solutions show potential, solving the issue of irreversible actions in transactions is out of scope for this thesis as described in \bsref{sec:scope}. Due to this, no guarantees are given on the effect of using irreversible actions in transactions, and it is thus discouraged.

\section{Conditional Synchronization}
\label{sec:req_conditional}
To be a valid alternative to locking C\#, an \ac{STM} system must be applicable to the same use cases as locking. This requires support for conditional synchronization so that \ac{STM} can be employed in well known scenarios such as shared buffers and other producer consumer setups\cite[p. 128]{tanenbaum2008modern}. \bsref{chap:stm_key_concepts} discusses the \bscode{retry} and \bscode{orElse} constructs proposed in \cite{harris2005composable} for conditional synchronization and composition of alternatives. Supporting such constructs in C\# will increase the applicability of the \ac{STM} system.

Our previous work in \cite{dpt907e14trending} includes an implementation of the $k$-means clustering algorithm\cite[p. 451]{dataminingconceptsandtechniques} in the functional programming language Clojure. Clojure contains a language integrated \ac{STM} implementation which does not support constructs such as \bscode{retry} and \bscode{orElse}. As a result the implementation requires the use of condition variables and busy waiting in scenarios where the \bscode{retry} construct could have been employed\cite{duffy2010stmnet}. Supplying \bscode{retry} and \bscode{orElse} constructs in C\# will allow for simpler conditional synchronization without the need for busy waiting, thereby increasing the simplicity and writability in such scenarios.

A disadvantage of providing the \bscode{retry} and \bscode{orElse} constructs is reduced simplicity. However, as the \bscode{retry} and \bscode{orElse} constructs are optional, the effects of this disadvantage are reduced. Therefore the conditional synchronization constructs are included in \stmname.

\section{Nesting}
\label{sec:stm_req_nesting}
The traditional lock-based approach to concurrency has issues with composability due to the threat of deadlocks when composing lock based code\cite[p. 58]{sutter2005software}. \ac{STM} attempts to mitigate these issues by removing the risk of deadlocks, by allowing transactions to nest. Nesting can occur both lexically and dynamically\cite[p. 1]{kumar2011hparstm}\cite[p. 42]{harris2010transactional}\cite[p. 2081]{herlihy2011tm}.

%\bsref{lst:stm_nested_transactions} shows an example of lexically nested transaction while \bsref{lst:stm_nested_transactions_real} shows an example of dynamically nested transactions. Here the withdraw and deposit methods on the accounts are themselves defined using transactions.

%
%	atomic{
%		var amount = 200;
%		account1.withdraw(amount);
%		account2.deposit(amount);
%	}
%      
%\end{lstlisting}

An \ac{STM} system for C\# must support nesting of transactions as this will allow the system to mitigate one of the major caveats associated with lock based concurrency. A more in depth description of the composability problems of the lock-based concurrency model and nesting of transactions can be found in our prior work \cite{dpt907e14trending}.

Different semantics exist for nesting of transactions. These are:  \begin{inparaenum}
\item Flat,
\item Open and
\item Closed\cite[p. 1]{kumar2011hparstm}\cite[p. 42]{harris2010transactional}.
\end{inparaenum}
Flat nesting treats any nested transactions as part of the already executing transaction, meaning that an abort of the nested transaction also aborts the enclosing transaction. Closed nested semantics allows nested transactions to abort independently of the enclosing transaction. Under closed nested semantics, commits by nested transactions only propagate any changes to the enclosing transaction, as opposed to the entire system. Open nesting allows nested transactions to commit even if the enclosing transaction aborts and propagates changes made by nested transactions to the entire system whenever a nested transaction commits.

Flat nesting is the simplest to implement, but closed and especially open nesting allows for higher degrees of concurrency\cite[p. 43]{harris2010transactional}. Considering the simplicity, readability and level of abstraction provided by the different strategies, as well as the degree of concurrency offered, closed nesting is selected for \stmnamesp. In order to improve the orthogonality \stmnamesp is required to support both lexical and dynamic nesting.

\section{Opacity}
\label{sec:stm_req_opacity}
Opacity is a correctness criteria requiring transactions to only read consistent data throughout their execution\cite[p. 1]{guerraoui2007opacity}\cite[p. 29]{harris2010transactional}. This means that transactions must not read data which will cause them to abort at a later time. Consequently opacity requires that the value read is consistent when the read occurs, but allows the variable to be changed at some later point by another transaction. Transactions must be aborted when reads cannot be guaranteed to be consistent.

By providing opacity, programmers do not have to reason about problems that occur as a result of inconsistent reads\cite[p. 28]{harris2010transactional}, thereby simplifying the programming model. As an example, consider \bsref{lst:stm_opacity}

\begin{lstlisting}[label=lst:stm_opacity,

  using System.Threading;

  public class Opacity
  {
    private atomic static int X = 10;
    private atomic static int Y = 10;

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      var t1 = new Thread(() =>
      {
        atomic
        {
          X = 20;
          Y = 20;
        }
      });

      var t2 = new Thread(() =>
      {
        atomic
        {
          var tmpx = X;
          var tmpy = Y;
          while (tmpx != tmpy)
          {
          }
        }
      });

      t1.Start();
      t2.Start();
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}
where the two transactional variables \bscode{X} and \bscode{Y} are defined on lines 5 and 6 as well as the two threads \bscode{t1} and \bscode{t2} are defined on lines 10 and 19. \bscode{t1} simply sets the value of \bscode{X} and \bscode{Y} as a transaction. \bscode{t2} enters a transaction in which it reads the values of \bscode{X} and \bscode{Y} entering a loop if the values are not equal. Consider the interleaving shown in \bsref{fig:opacity_interleaving}. The transaction executed by \bscode{t2} reads the value 10 associated with the variable X after which \bscode{t1}'s transaction updates the value of both  \bscode{X} and \bscode{Y} to 20. \bscode{t2} reads the value 20 associated with \bscode{Y.} In an \ac{STM} system providing opacity, this would not be allowed since the transaction would read inconsistent data. If the \ac{STM} system does not provide opacity \bscode{t2} will enter an infinite loop as \bscode{tmpx} and \bscode{tmpy} are not equal.

\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{\rootpath/worksheets/stm_requirements/figures/opacity_interleaving}
\caption{Opacity interleaving example}
\label{fig:opacity_interleaving}
\end{figure}

As opacity bolster the simplicity of using \ac{STM}, it is required for \stmname. This will positively impact the readability and writability.

\section{Summary of Requirements}\label{sec:sum_of_req}
In the following section, the requirements will be summarized in order to give a clear overview of properties \stmnamesp must have.

The granularity of tracking \stmnamesp will provide, is on the variable level. That is, the assignments to variables will be tracked, however side-effects to the referenced object will not. Tracking the internals of an object will require the fields of the object to be marked as transactional. A transaction scope can be defined by a syntax extension provided in \stmname. Transactions in \stmnamesp are executed under the guarantee of strong atomicity, providing isolation between transactional and non-transactional code. As the \ac{STM} system does not track side-effects, use of immutable objects is promoted. Exceptions occurring inside a transaction will be propagated out of the transaction if the transaction is able to commit. Thus transactions will only be used for synchronization, not recovery of state. All irreversible actions, as mentioned in \bsref{subsec:irreversible} are discouraged. \stmnamesp must facilitate conditional synchronization, by supplying the \bscode{retry} and \bscode{orElse} constructs. Nesting is allowed in \stmnamesp under closed nesting semantics, which strikes a balance between minimizing aborts and ensuring simple semantics for nested transactions. Lastly, opacity will be required for \stmname, as this correctness criteria will bolster the simplicity of the \ac{STM} system.
