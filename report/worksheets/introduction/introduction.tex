\section{Motivation}


%Resent studies done by \cite{dpt907e14trending} shows 
% The increase of CPU speed is in additional cores
% Requires concurrent programming to utilize
% Programming for shared-memory concurrency is difficoult
% STM eases this
% Not integrated in C#
% Roslyn is open source


\section{Related Work}

%Composable memory transactions
%Language support forlightweight transaction
%Usability study
