<h2 id="question.1">Does Multiverse rely on instrumentation</h2>
No; it doesn't. Although instrumentation makes a cleaner integration in Java possible, it is a hassle to integrate
        in real projects. So instrumentation has been dropped.

<h2 id="question.2">Can Multiverse be used with different languages?</h2>
Multiverse can be used with different Java based languages like Groovy or Scala. For Groovy integration see the
        <a href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/">GPars</a> project.

<h2 id="question.3">Can I use arbitrary threads?</h2>
Yes you can. Multiverse doesn't require any special threads or any special settings on threads.

<h2 id="question.4">Can multiple STM instances be used within the same JVM?</h2>
Yes you can. But each transactional object only belongs to a single STM instance. If you combine different STM's you
        will get exceptions.

<h2 id="question.5">Do I need a special JVM?</h2>
No you don't. You can use an ordinary Java 1.6+ JVM like the JVM from Sun/Oracle or IBM.

<h2 id="question.6">Can the changes be persisted?</h2>
No, for the moment this isn't possible. But hooking some kind of persistance mechanism up to the stm shouldn't be
impossible and is planned for the future.

<h2 id="question.7">Can Multiverse be distributed</h2>
No, for the moment.

<h2 id="question.8">Which License is used</h2>
Multiverse is released under the <a href="license.html">Apache 2 License</a>.

<h2 id="question.9">Does Multiverse support blocking transactions?</h2>
Yes. For more information about blocking operations, check the <a href="manual-blocking.html">5 Minute guide to
    blocking transactions</a>.

<h2 id="question.10">Does Multiverse scale linearly?</h2>
It depends. With the introduction of Multiverse 0.7, there is no shared clock. So independant parts of the system
        can scale independantly.

<h2 id="question.11">Does Multiverse prevent deadlocking?</h2>
Yes. As long as transactional resources of Multiverse are used, transactions won't deadlock. There are 2 requirements
for a deadlock:
<ol>
    <li>uncontrolled order of locking</li>
    <li>uncontrolled waiting</li>
</ol>
Acquiring locks in Multiverse is done with a maximum waiting time, so the second condition for a deadlock is
not present. The lock behavior can be customized by providing a custom CommitLockPolicy implementation.

<h2 id="question.12">Does Multiverse prevent livelocking?</h2>
Multiverse is very optimistic, so it could be that while reading/writing to transactional object a failure is encountered
or when the transaction commits. The TxnExecutor automatically retries the transaction in the hope that it
will succeed next time. Uncontrolled retrying could lead to livelocking because resources are consumed (memory
and cpu cycles) but no progress is made because transaction keep aborting. By default a bound number of retries will be used
        and the livelocking transaction will eventually fail with a TooManyRetriesException.

<h2 id="question.13">Does Multiverse prevent starvation?</h2>
No. Multiverse doesn't provide any guarantee that transaction that content over resources are going to commit. Meaning
that a transaction eventually fails with a TooManyRetriesException. A practical example of starving transactions
are long running transactions, the keep conflicting on very short running transactions. In the future a
contention manager is going to be added, but for the time being there is no support available.

<h2 id="question.14">Does Multiverse suffer from Zombie threads?</h2>
It depends. By default no zombie threads are possible, but if lower than SERIALIZED isolation level is selected, zombie
        threads are possible and there currently is no protection agains them. So using a lowe level isolation level should
        be used with care.

<h2 id="question.15">Can non transactional objects be used in transactions?</h2>
Yes you can. Normal objects can be used in transactions, for example a normal Person POJO be exchanged over a transactional BlockingQueue
for example. But changes made on these objects won't be protected by the transaction, so you need to
know what you are doing.

<h2 id="question.16">Can IO be used in transactions?</h2>
It is possible to do IO  in a transaction, but it could be that the transaction is aborted and restarted many times
(for example because a read conflict or write conflict is encountered). It is possible to register tasks to be executed
when a Transaction aborts or commits, giving the option to 'undo' what is done. Support for transacional IO is planned,
but doesn't have a high priority at the moment.

<h2 id="question.17">Does Multiverse provide support for pessimistic locking?</h2>
Yes. See the Lock and LockMode.

<h2 id="question.18">Does Multiverse provide support for nesting transactions?</h2>
Yes. Transactions can be nested and atm they will always be flattened (so only the outer transaction counts). An abort
or commit will always be executed on the while transaction and not subtransactions.

<h2 id="question.19">Does Multiverse allow non transactional access?</h2>
It depends. It isn't possible to see changes made by transactions in progress (so no dirty reads).

<h2 id="question.20">Does Multiverse support early or late conflict detection?</h2>
It depends.

<h2 id="question.21">Does Multiverse support direct or deferred updates?</h2>
Multiverse only supports deferred updates, so the changes are made visible to other transaction when the transaction commits.
        That is why dirty reads are not possible.

<h2 id="question.22">Can Multiverse be combined with traditional lock based technology?</h2>
Yes, it can. But this is not without risk; changes made in non transactional resources are not protected by the STM.
And blocking operations on non transactional resouces, doesnt benefit from deadlock detection, listening
to multiple blocking resources, etc. So if you know what you are doing, traditional lock based technology can
be combined with Multiverse.

<h2 id="question.23">Are Multiverse Transactions thread-safe?</h2>
No, a transaction is not thread-safe to use and therefor can't be used by multiple threads
concurrently. It is possible however to hand over a transaction from one thread to another
because the transation itself doesn't rely on any thread/threadlocal information. But it could
be that the systems in front of the STM does rely on this. So threads
can safely be handed over from one thread to another, if you really know what you are doing.
<p>
    The org.multiverse.api.Txn can be compared to the Hibernate Session, that also isn't threadsafe to use.

<h2 id="question.24">Is lock based concurrency control bad?</h2>
I certainly don't think that lock based concurrency control is bad. Multiverse even couldn't exist with low
level synchronization structures like locks or cas instructions (AtomicLongs for example). But I do think that
lock based concurrency control is very complex; it is very easy to get in all sorts of traditional problems (race problems,
deadlocks etc) even for the more experienced developer. And next these well known issues, it also is quite
easy to introduce reordening or visibility problems if you don't understand the Java Memory Model well.
<p>
    That is why I think that STM's are a very valuable tool in the toolbox of developers, that could boost
    productivity if used correctly. You could compare it with Hibernate and raw SQL; Hibernate makes live easy
    because you don't need to deal with all the SQL issues all the time. But from time to time, you need to get
    dirty and use SQL directly to get the things done.

<h2 id="question.25">Multiverse and the Java Memory Model</h2>
The Java Memory Model is defined in happens before rules, for example the volatile variable rule that states
that all changes made before a volatile write, will be visible when a volatile read is done. Using this mechanism
it is possible to hand over an object graph from one thread to another without worrying about visibility
or reordering issues. Multiverse also provides a happens before rule: all changes made before a transaction commits,
will be visible to all starting transactions. So you don't need to worry about reordering or visibility problems.
<p>
    On a lower level this behavior is realized using CAS instructions (for example an AtomicReference) that provides
    the same happens before semantics as volatile variables.

<h2 id="question.26">Does Multiverse have object or field granularity?</h2>
Multiverse doesn't support instrumentation (anymore), so evertything will be field level granularity.

<h2 id="question.27">Does Multiverse have provides support for contention management?</h2>
No. Currently Multiverse doesn't provide any support for contention management. Contention management if very
usefull to provide certain fairness guarantees and to prevent livelocking and will be added in the future.
The big problem I currently see is that it could cause a lot of overhead and adding it all over could
impact performance all over. I believe that you only should pay for something when you are using it.

<h2 id="question.28">Can Multiverse be combined with Spring/Guice/...?</h2>
Yes it can. But atm there is no spring TransactionManager, so you have to make use of the instrumentation
or you have to make use of a more explicit approach (TransactionlReference/TransactionTemplate).
