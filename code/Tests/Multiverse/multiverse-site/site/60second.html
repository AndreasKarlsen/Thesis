<h1>60 Second guide to Multiverse</h1>

Multiverse is a Software Transansactional Memory (STM) implementation and meant as an alternative to traditional lock
based concurrency control. If you have worked with databases before, STM should feel familiar because
both share one very important concept: transactions. Mutuable state that needs be accessed transactionally should be stored
in transactional references (comparible to the atomic references from java.util.concurrent.atomic package).
</p>

Underneath you can see a small example of an Account with 2 mutable fields: balance and lastUpdate. These 2 fields
        will be updated atomically in the incBalance method using a transaction.
<pre>

    import org.multiverse.api.references.*;
    import static org.multiverse.api.StmUtils.*;

    public class Account{

        private final TxnRef&lt;Date&gt; lastUpdate;
        private final TxnInteger balance;

        public Account(int balance){
            this.lastUpdate = newTxnRef&lt;Date&gt;(new Date());
            this.balance = newTxnInteger(balance);
        }

        public void incBalance(final int amount, final Date date){
            atomic(new Runnable(){
                public void run(){
                    balance.inc(amount);
                    lastUpdate.set(date);

                    if(balance.get()&lt;0){
                        throw new IllegalStateException("Not enough money");
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    }
</pre>
The transactional behavior of the incBalance method gives us:
<ol>
    <li><b>failure atomicity:</b> all writes will commit or none will commit. In this case it could happen that
        money is withdrawn and the balance becomes negative. At the end this will be detected, but the changes are
        already made. The STM will make sure that these changes will never be committed.
    </li>
    <li><b>isolation: </b> all reads and writes are thread-safe and are isolated from
        other transaction. A txn automatically gets a Oracle version of the SERIALIZABLE isolation level.
        You don't need to deal with lower isolation levels like READ_UNCOMMITTED, READ_COMMITTED or
        REPEATABLE_READ.
    </li>
    <li><b>no deadlocks</b> between transactions because deadlocks are prevented by Multiverse.
</ol>

<h2>Composing transactional methods</h2>

Transactional methods can also be composed in new transactional methods, e.g.

<pre>
    public static void transfer(final Account from, final Account to, final int amount){
        atomic(new Runnable(){
            public void run(){
                Date date = new Date();

                from.incBalance(-amount, date);
                to.incBalance(amount, date);
             }
        });
    }
</pre>
    With lock based concurrency control this is dangerous to do since you can quickly run into a deadlock (e.g. when
        2 threads are transferring money from 2 accounts in the opposite direction). But with STM, deadlocks
        will be prevented and transactions retried automatically.

<p/>
This example only scratches the surface of Multiverse, but just having transactional methods can be
a very big step forward in a lot of cases. For more advanced features and in-depth documention, the
