<h1>Overview</h1>
Multiverse is a Java based
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_transactional_Memory">Software Transactional Memory</a> (STM)
implementation that wants to realize the following goals:
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Language independent:</b> so it can be used without relying on instrumentation and therefore can
        easily be used with other languages that can run on the JVM like Scala, Groovy or JRuby.
    <li>
        <b>Framework:</b> for different STM implementation. This makes it easy to experiment with new features
        or build a customized STM implementation.
    </li>
</ol>
