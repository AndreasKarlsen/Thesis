<h1>Mission statement</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Reduce complexity of concurrency control</b> where applicable by raising the abstraction level. The goal
        is not to replace traditional concurrency control completely, but to provide an alternative programming
        model. Multiverse can be seen as filling the gap between traditional databases and traditional lock based concurrency
        control.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Seamless integration in the Java projects</b>. Multiverse doesn't rely on instrumentation, so can seamlessly
        be integrated in complexer builds. Multiverse also tries to stay out of the design of projects that use it as much
        as possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>To be integrated in other JVM based languages</b> like Scala, Groovy or JRuby. Although Multiverse has been
        written with Java in mind, it can also be integrated in other languages. Multiverse is uses under water in the
        Groovy Parallel Systems Library: <a href="http://gpars.codehaus.org/">GPars</a>  and in the past has been used
        as the STM implementation in Scala based Actor framework <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Production environment quality.</b> Multiverse is not an academic experiment. The goal is
        to create a library that can be used in the most demanding production environments.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Provide a framework for STM experiments.</b> It should be easy to swap/tune the STM implementation without
        causing a big impact.
    </li>
</ol>
